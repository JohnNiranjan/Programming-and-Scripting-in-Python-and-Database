<h2>Description</h2>
This Project documents a two-part project that combines SQL relational database design (for a car sales company) and a foundational Python application prototype (for a pizza delivery service).

Key Features and Technologies:

Database Design (MySQL): Created a relational schema with salespersons, customers, and orders tables. This design includes setting up primary keys, unique constraints, and foreign keys with 

ON DELETE CASCADE and ON DELETE SET NULL rules.


Advanced SQL & Data Archiving: Implemented logic to update customer ratings based on order history using a complex UPDATE query with nested SELECT and HAVING clauses. Created archival tables (

orders_placed_history and orders_bkp) for legal compliance and data backup.


Python Application (CLI): Developed a simple command-line Python application for customer data management.


Customer CRUD Prototype: Implemented core functions to add, search (by contact number), and update customer details using a persistent global dictionary structure.
